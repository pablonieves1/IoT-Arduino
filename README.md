# IoT-Arduino
Repository to develop the code for Arduino based  device to monitor and display multiple metrics from the stock market on a screen.

Current version supports is developed in the Arduino IDE (C++) for the microcontroller ESP8266 with the IoT philosophy.
The data is pulled from the Finnhub API, which gives the real-time current price and the percent variation for an entire day.

Next step will be to scale the code to display the values on a LED screen with horizontal movement.
